INHERITENCE:
1. In software development , it is better to use existing resources/code rather than creating all over again. 
2. This is done using inheritence property which provides outstanding reusability of existing code and which is very imp feature of OOP.
3. Inheritence provides us a way using which we can use existing code's property in new code.
4. e.g. Android version 1.0,2.0,3.0 => when they developed android version 2.0 they inherited properties of 1.0 in that and developed new features in 2.0 that they 
required in 2.0 .


Types of Inheritence:
1. Simple inheritance:  class A => class B                           ------------> One base class and One derived class.
                                                        class A
                                                           ||
                                                        class B     
                                                       

2. Multilevel Inheritance : class A => class B => class C => class D ------------> One base class -> next derived act as base for its next.
                                                        class A
                                                           ||
                                                        class B
                                                           ||
                                                        class C
                                                        

3. Hierarchical Inheritance: class A => (class A, class B, class C)  ------------> One base class and multiple derived class.
                                                        class A
                                                 ||        ||       ||
                                              class B   class C   class D
                                              

4. Hybrid Inheritance : Multiple Inheritance + Multilevel Inheritance.

5. Multiple Inheritance: In Java this inheritance is not applicable but concept of that is implemented using INTERFACES.
