/*
Interfaces:
A interfaces is kind of class.It is class like structure which contains only Abstract methods and final fields.

1. Abstract Methods:Abstract methods/functions are such types of functions whicha do not contains curly braces or we can say that which do not implemented.
	e.g :void function();
  
2.final fields: I know that. once we declared one method as final we cannot declare method with same name in further program.	once we declare varible with final keyword 
then we cannot change it's value.

IMP Note: Concept of Multiple Inheritance can be implemented using Interface in java but it is not present in java directly.
